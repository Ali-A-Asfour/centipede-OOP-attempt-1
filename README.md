<h1>Centipede Using OOP Java Attempt One</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project serves as an introductory exploration of Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, with a primary focus on gaining familiarity with the language. While efficiency and optimization are not our immediate concerns, our objective is to grasp the fundamentals of Java and OOP principles through a Centipede game implementation.

      <li>Implement power-ups that affect gameplay.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Shooting Mechanism:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the player to shoot projectiles (bullets or lasers).</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Scoring and Level Progression:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep track of the player's score.</li>
      <li>Implement level progression with increasing difficulty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>UI and HUD (User Interface and Heads-Up Display):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and display game elements such as score and lives.</li>
      <li>Show game over screens and victory conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Game Logic and Rules:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Define the game's rules, including win and lose conditions.</li>
      <li>Handle game events like game over or level completion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Collision Detection:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement collision detection between different game objects.</li>
      <li>Handle collision resolution, such as object destruction or movement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Game Loop:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a game loop for continuous updates and rendering.</li>
      <li>Manage game timing and frame rate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Input Handling:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Capture user input for character control and shooting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and implement classes and objects using OOP principles.</li>
      <li>Utilize concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Thoroughly test the game and identify and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Documentation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Document the code with comments and detailed documentation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
